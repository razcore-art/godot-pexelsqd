# Godot PexelsQD

Artists quick draw app inspired by [line-of-action](//line-of-action.com/)/[quickposes](//quickposes.com/). But instead of a static database of pictures, I'm using free online collections.

I'm using:

- [GodotEngine](//godotengine.org/) for coding the app
- [Pexels](//pexels.com/) for the images
- [Feather](//feathericons.com/) for the icons
- [Nord](//nordtheme.com/) as the theme

## Note

You need your own [Pexels API-KEY](//www.pexels.com/api/). You can get one for free by registering at Pexels.
